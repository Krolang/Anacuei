## Testing the Router
1. CHECK FOR DNS LEAKS! Go to this website while connected to the router: https://dns-leak.com/. If it shows your ISPâ€™s DNS servers, one or more of the config files may be misconfigured, or your ISP is somehow overriding your custom DNS.
2. Try going to a page with a lot of ads and see if Pi-Hole is running. If not, look to their documentation to troubleshoot.
3. Refer to the testing sections of the other pages in this documentation.
